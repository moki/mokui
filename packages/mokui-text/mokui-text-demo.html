The United States-China relationship is at a stunning low: A trade war is currently enveloping both countries and knocking the legs out from an already shaky global economy; Chinese researchers, accused of spycraft, are under suspicion at United States research facilities; and after three decades of manufacturing codependency, both countries are disentangling their supply chains. Last year, FBI director Christopher Wray underscored the animosity between the two countries when he testified that “the China threat [is] not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat.”

Journalist Matt Sheehan’s new book, The Transpacific Experiment, is thus a timely reminder that the United States-China relationship has been instrumental in the development of a prized cornerstone of the U.S. economy — Silicon Valley. Sheehan, a Paulson Institute fellow, lays out how the human and financial capital shared between the two countries helped facilitate the development of two massive tech industries, with some unexpected consequences: Chinese electric bus manufacturers setting up shop in California, Chinese moguls snapping up American movie theater chains, and the rise of “sea turtles,” a Mandarin term for Chinese students who choose to come back home after getting their education at U.S. universities.

                        But over the last few years, Sheehan writes, that relationship has deteriorated. Once interdependent, the Silicon Valley and the Chinese tech industries are now in cutthroat competition for talent, investment, and markets. And things aren’t looking good for the United States.
